A few useful userscripts for github. They were originally created in a
scikit-learn context but are likely to be useful outside it.

* expand outdated comments in github (current shortcut in Control-Alt-P), which
  makes it easy to search through the full content in a PR. It expands:
  outdated diff comments, folded conversations (aka "items not shown") and
  large diffs.
* adds a CircleCI button to easily access HTML generated CircleCI doc
* removes opened issues and opened PRs count from github pages

To use these userscripts you will need to have a userscript manager installed
in your browser such as [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) or
[TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).
